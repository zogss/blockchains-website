            Contracts and Tokenisation?
          </p>
          <div class="d-flex flex-column gap-1 font-georgia">
            <p class="text-start fs-6"><strong>“Blockchain”</strong>
              is a technological system where data is recorded on a number of
              decentralised ledgers (the so-called "distributed ledgers"), which
              are maintained on the computers that form part of the blockchain,
              the nodes. Every time that data is to be added to the blockchain,
              each node is expected to update the copy of the ledger maintained
              by it by adding the new 'block' to the existing chain.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start fs-6">A new block is added to the various
              ledgers only if the blockchain algorithm has positively completed
              a secure validation procedure involving all the participating
              nodes (the "consensus protocol"), and once the new block is added,
              there is no way to delete such entry, for which reason blockchains
              are considered immutable.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start fs-6">Other important features of blockchain
              are that any block being added to the ledgers is timestamped and
              cryptographed, so that data can be recorded in a secure, and
              auditable way.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start fs-6">The blockchain updates are managed by
              complex and automated algorithm, so that the risk of human error
              is minimised and there is no need (necessarily) for intermediaries
              to manage the blockchain or carry out reconciliation activities on
              the recorded data.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start fs-6">Finally, it is important to distinguish
              between public and private blockchains. Public blockchains are
              also referred to as 'permissionless', as anyone can join the
              blockchain without obtaining any permission, by making available a
              computer (node) that offers computing power helping the blockchain
              perform the required calculations (and by so-doing being involved
              in the consensus process). Conversely, private blockchains are
              those where a node can only join the blockchain if granted with a
              permission to do so.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start fs-6"><strong>“Smart Contracts”</strong>
              on blockchains are blocks of code designed to ensure that certain
              actions are performed within the blockchain or triggered outside
              the blockchain, upon the occurrence of pre-determined conditions
              as agreed upon between the relevant parties.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start fs-6">In a structured finance context, smart
              contacts could for instance be those automated processes that
              ensure that payments are made on a given payment date, that
              additional collateral is posted depending on the quality of the
              portfolio data made available on reports, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start fs-6"><strong>"Tokenisation"</strong>, or the
              process whereby a typically illiquid asset held by an issuer could
              be converted into a fixed number of liquid tokens (having a
              fractional value of the original illiquid asset) to be acquired by
              investors (who in turn could further subdivide such liquid tokens)
              has been used by a number of market participants(for example,
              Aspen Coin, which tokenises real estate property for investors).
            </p>
            <p class="text-start fs-6">The main benefit of tokenising assets is
              that it increases the liquidity of the assets which can then be
              traded on a secondary market of the issuer’s choice. Since tokens
              are highly divisible, investors can also purchase tokens that
              represent very small percentages of the underlying assets making
              investing much more accessible. Finally, because the transaction
              of tokens is completed using smart contracts, certain parts of the
              exchange process are automated which reduces the administrative
              burden involved in trading. With fewer intermediaries, deals can
              be executed faster and with lower transaction fees.
            </p>

          <p class="text-start fw-semibold fs-4">How blockchain could benefit
            structured finance</p>
          <p class="text-start fs-6 font-georgia">There are a number of benefits
            which blockchain could bring to securitisation:</p>
          <ul
            class="list-group d-flex flex-column gap-3 ps-5 font-georgia fs-6"
          >
            <li class="list-group-item-light"><strong>immutable, traceable audit
                trail:</strong>
              from loan origination to primary issuance, and changes in
              ownership in the secondary market, blockchain can create a
              chronological and immutable audit trail of all transactions. With
              this capability, regulators and auditors can get a view of the
              ownership and title of the underlying securitised assets;</li>
            <li class="list-group-item-light"><strong>speed and certainty:</strong>
              blockchain through its disintermediation and simultaneous
              recording of information across the system, can almost totally
              eliminate time lags in information and payment flows throughout
              the securitisation process, including in the secondary market.
              This increase in speed and certainty could significantly reduce
              counterparty risk, release capital, and reduce the return
              thresholds that investors require;</li>
            <li class="list-group-item-light"><strong>security:</strong>
              blockchain’s capacity to increase the security of transactions and
              data, and mitigate fraud could be appealing to the securitisation
              (and indeed generally the financial services) industry, where
              integrity of data is paramount, especially if compared to an
              industry that is essentially based on exchanges of emails and all
              security issues relating to them. One important aspect to consider
              is that given the interconnectivity of all segments within the
              blockchain, wrong entries (because of their erroneous or malicious
              nature) would automatically reverberate in several layers of the
              blockchain and the validation protocols would prevent such mistake
              from going unnoticed; and</li>
            <li class="list-group-item-light"><strong>data:</strong>
              information could be presented to all relevant stakeholders for
              due diligence, monitoring and execution purposes. In a structured
              finance context, data recorded on the ledgers tends to correspond
              to financial transactions, and for such reason it is more likely
              that blockchain securitisations will be "private" blockchains;
              however, they may be designed so as to have different permissioned
              rights so that depending on the type of user (and its role within
              the securitisation) different levels of disclosure may be applied
              (e.g. a security trustee required to notify the underlying
              borrowers may need to have access to personal data, rating
              agencies may need to have access on reports as well as certain
              information (e.g. around swap pricing) which may not be
              disclosable to all transaction parties). Better and more frequent
              data could also create more business opportunities - for example,
              making granular information available on a daily basis could help
              arrangers cut the securitisation pool in a more precise way and
              eventually result in better pricing in the interest of all
              parties.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The above benefits could in turn lead to greater efficiency, speed,
            transparency and safety on the securitisation market, which could
            lead to a higher investor appetite and improve pricing, volume and
            spreads, which could lead to more issuers and borrowers using
            securitisation as a funding means.</p>
